        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>I am mostly self taught but I learned the most with a structured cirriculum. having college education and supplementing my learning through other online resources such as:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>TreeHouse</li>
          <li>Udemy</li>
          <li>FreeCodeCamp</li>
          <li>CodeAcademy</li>
          <li>Kahn Academy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I have learned differently from each of these above listed resources but the one that fully guided me and informed me about learning to code was Treehouse.Investing in myself was the best decision I have ever made and I will continue to reach my goals and dreams. </p>
